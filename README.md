
# ModernBERT Tokenizer and Model Evaluation

This project explores the capabilities of ModernBERT and the former bert model by analyzing their tokenization processes and evaluating their performance on various text inputs. It is designed for educational purposes and serves as a starting point for deeper exploration of NLP models.


## Features

- **Tokenizer Analysis**: Analyze the tokenization behavior of BERT and ModernBert models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate ModernBERT's embedding generation and hidden states.
